2.  **Content Marketing:**
    *   **Activity:** Develop a content calendar featuring blog posts, articles, and short videos related to the conference themes (e.g., "Top 5 Tech Innovations to Watch," "Why AI is Reshaping Industries"). These will be published on the conference website and shared across social media. Testimonials from previous attendees or sneak peeks of speaker topics will also be utilized.
