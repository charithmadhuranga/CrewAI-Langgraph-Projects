## AI Agent Projects with CrewAI and LangGraph

This repository is a collection of projects demonstrating the power of multi-agent systems using CrewAI and LangGraph. It serves as a practical guide for building, orchestrating, and managing autonomous AI agents that can solve complex tasks.

## Key Features

Multi-Agent Orchestration: Learn how to design systems where multiple specialized agents collaborate to achieve a common goal.

Tool Usage: See how agents can leverage external tools, like web search, to gather real-time information.

Memory Management: Explore techniques for giving agents a memory of past conversations and user preferences to provide more personalized results.

Frameworks: Dive into hands-on examples for both CrewAI (for sequential and hierarchical task execution) and LangGraph (for building stateful, cyclic agent workflows).
